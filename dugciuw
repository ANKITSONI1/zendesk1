Events
This is a read-only API to the GitHub events. These events power the various activity streams on the site.

List public events
List repository events
List issue events for a repository
List public events for a network of repositories
List public events for an organization
List events that a user has received
List public events that a user has received
List events performed by a user
List public events performed by a user
List events for an organization
Events are optimized for polling with the "ETag" header. If no new events have been triggered, you will see a "304 Not Modified" response, and your current rate limit will be untouched. There is also an "X-Poll-Interval" header that specifies how often (in seconds) you are allowed to poll. In times of high server load, the time may increase. Please obey the header.

curl -I https://api.github.com/users/tater/events
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-Poll-Interval: 60
ETag: "a18c3bded88eb5dbb5c849a489412bf3"
# The quotes around the ETag value are important
curl -I https://api.github.com/users/tater/events \
   -H 'If-None-Match: "a18c3bded88eb5dbb5c849a489412bf3"'
HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified
X-Poll-Interval: 60
Events support pagination, however the per_page option is unsupported. The fixed page size is 30 items. Fetching up to ten pages is supported, for a total of 300 events.

Only events created within the past 90 days will be included in timelines. Events older than 90 days will not be included (even if the total number of events in the timeline is less than 300).

All Events have the same response format:

Status: 200 OK

      <https://api.github.com/resource?page=5>; rel="last"

Events
This is a read-only API to the GitHub events. These events power the various activity streams on the site.

List repository events
List issue events for a repository
List public events for a network of repositories
List public events for an organization
List events that a user has received

Events are optimized for polling with the "ETag" header. If no new events have been triggered, you will see a "304 Not Modified" response, and your current rate limit will be untouched. There is also an "X-Poll-Interval" header that specifies how often (in seconds) you are allowed to poll. In times of high server load, the time may increase. Please obey the header.

curl -I https://api.github.com/users/tater/events
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-Poll-Interval: 60
ETag: "a18c3bded88eb5dbb5c849a489412bf3"
# The quotes around the ETag value are important
curl -I https://api.github.com/users/tater/events \
   -H 'If-None-Match: "a18c3bded88eb5dbb5c849a489412bf3"'
HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified
X-Poll-Interval: 60
Events support pagination, however the per_page option is unsupported. The fixed page size is 30 items. Fetching up to ten pages is supported, for a total of 300 events.

Only events created within the past 90 days will be included in timelines. Events older than 90 days will not be included (even if the total number of events in the timeline is less than 300).

All Events have the same response format:

Status: 200 OK
Link: <https://api.github.com/resource?page=2>; rel="next",
      <https://api.github.com/resource?page=5>; rel="last"

Events are optimized for polling with the "ETag" header. If no new events have been triggered, you will see a "304 Not Modified" response, and your current rate limit will be untouched. There is also an "X-Poll-Interval" header that specifies how often (in seconds) you are allowed to poll. In times of high server load, the time may increase. Please obey the header.

curl -I https://api.github.com/users/tater/events
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-Poll-Interval: 60
ETag: "a18c3bded88eb5dbb5c849a489412bf3"
# The quotes around the ETag value are important
curl -I https://api.github.com/users/tater/events \

X-Poll-Interval: 60
Events support pagination, however the per_page option is unsupported. The fixed page size is 30 items. Fetching up to ten pages is supported, for a total of 300 events.

Only events created within the past 90 days will be included in timelines. Events older than 90 days will not be included (even if the total number of events in the timeline is less than 300).

All Events have the same response format:

Events are optimized for polling with the "ETag" header. If no new events have been triggered, you will see a "304 Not Modified" response, and your current rate limit will be untouched. There is also an "X-Poll-Interval" header that specifies how often (in seconds) you are allowed to poll. In times of high server load, the time may increase. Please obey the header.

curl -I https://api.github.com/users/tater/events
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-Poll-Interval: 60
ETag: "a18c3bded88eb5dbb5c849a489412bf3"

Events support pagination, however the per_page option is unsupported. The fixed page size is 30 items. Fetching up to ten pages is supported, for a total of 300 events.

Only events created within the past 90 days will be included in timelines. Events older than 90 days will not be included (even if the total number of events in the timeline is less than 300).

All Events have the same response format:

Events are optimized for polling with the "ETag" header. If no new events have been triggered, you will see a "304 Not Modified" response, and your current rate limit will be untouched. There is also an "X-Poll-Interval" header that specifies how often (in seconds) you are allowed to poll. In times of high server load, the time may increase. Please obey the header.

curl -I https://api.github.com/users/tater/events
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-Poll-Interval: 60
ETag: "a18c3bded88eb5dbb5c849a489412bf3"
# The quotes around the ETag value are important
curl -I https://api.github.com/users/tater/events \
   -H 'If-None-Match: "a18c3bded88eb5dbb5c849a489412bf3"'
HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified
X-Poll-Interval: 60
Events support pagination, however the per_page option is unsupported. The fixed page size is 30 items. Fetching up to ten pages is supported, for a total of 300 events.

Only events created within the past 90 days will be included in timelines. Events older than 90 days will not be included (even if the total number of events in the timeline is less than 300).

All Events have the same response format:
